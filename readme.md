### Detailed Project Description: Inventory Management System with Supplier Integration

#### Overview

This project involves building a full-stack inventory management system that allows businesses to track inventory levels, manage orders, and automatically reorder products from suppliers when stock levels are low. The system will consist of a React-based frontend for user interaction, a Node.js backend API for business logic, a SQL or MongoDB database for data storage, Redis for caching frequently accessed data, and Docker for containerization and deployment. This project is designed to integrate all these technologies in a way that is both functional and efficient.

### Project Components

#### 1. **Frontend (React)**

**Key Features:**
- **Product Management:** A UI where users can add, edit, and delete products. Each product should have the following attributes:
  - Name
  - SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
  - Description
  - Price
  - Current Stock Level
  - Reorder Level (the stock level at which a new order should be triggered)
  
- **Inventory Dashboard:**
  - Display a list of all products, showing their current stock levels.
  - Visual indicators (e.g., colors) for products that are low on stock.
  - A summary view showing key metrics such as total products, total stock value, and products below reorder level.

- **Order Management:**
  - Users can view and manage purchase orders.
  - Orders should have statuses like "Pending," "Completed," or "Cancelled."
  - Option to manually create a purchase order for products.
  
- **Supplier Management:**
  - Interface for adding and managing suppliers.
  - Each supplier should have attributes like:
    - Supplier Name
    - Contact Information
    - List of Products Supplied

- **Reporting and Analytics:**
  - A reporting section where users can generate reports based on time frames (e.g., last 30 days, last quarter) that show:
    - Inventory movement (e.g., which products were restocked or sold the most).
    - Stock value over time.
    - Supplier performance (e.g., delivery times, order fulfillment rates).

**Implementation Details:**
- Use React Hooks and functional components.
- Implement state management using Context API or Redux.
- For the UI, use a component library like Material-UI or Ant Design to speed up development and ensure a responsive design.
- Ensure form validations for user inputs (e.g., required fields, valid email formats for supplier contacts).
- Implement routing using React Router for navigating between different sections (e.g., Products, Orders, Suppliers, Reports).

#### 2. **Backend API (Node.js + Express)**

**Key Features:**
- **User Authentication:**
  - Implement JWT-based authentication.
  - Create middlewares for protecting routes (e.g., only authenticated users can access the dashboard).
  
- **Product Management API:**
  - Endpoints for CRUD operations on products.
  - Ensure validation on server-side (e.g., SKU uniqueness, positive stock levels).
  
- **Order Management API:**
  - Endpoints for creating and managing orders.
  - Logic to automatically create a purchase order when a productâ€™s stock falls below the reorder level.
  - Track order status and update stock levels upon order completion.
  
- **Supplier Management API:**
  - Endpoints for CRUD operations on suppliers.
  - Logic to associate suppliers with specific products.
  
- **Reporting API:**
  - Endpoints to generate reports on inventory and order statistics.
  - Use aggregation queries to calculate metrics like total stock value, most/least sold products, etc.

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Express.js for routing and middleware management.
- Implement Sequelize (for SQL) or Mongoose (for MongoDB) as an ORM/ODM to interact with the database.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, JWT secret).
- Implement data validation and sanitization using libraries like Joi or express-validator.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging, with meaningful HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).

#### 3. **Database (SQL/MongoDB)**

**Database Schema (SQL Example):**

- **Users:**
  - `id`, `username`, `password_hash`, `role`
  
- **Products:**
  - `id`, `name`, `sku`, `description`, `price`, `current_stock`, `reorder_level`
  
- **Suppliers:**
  - `id`, `name`, `contact_info`
  
- **Orders:**
  - `id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `order_date`, `status`
  
- **ProductSupplier (Many-to-Many Relationship):**
  - `product_id`, `supplier_id`

**Database Design Considerations:**
- Choose SQL if you need complex relationships and transactions. Use MongoDB for a more flexible schema, especially if your product attributes may vary or you expect rapid changes.
- Index columns that are frequently used in queries, such as `sku`, `name`, and `status`.
- For MongoDB, structure documents to embed related data when possible to reduce the need for joins.

#### 4. **Caching Layer (Redis)**

**Key Use Cases:**
- Cache frequently accessed data like product lists and inventory counts.
- Use Redis to store session information, especially if using a SQL database.
- Implement caching strategies such as:
  - **Write-through cache:** Update the cache immediately when data is written to the database.
  - **Cache invalidation:** Ensure that cache entries are expired or updated when the underlying data changes.

**Implementation Details:**
- Use the `redis` npm package to integrate Redis into your Node.js application.
- Set appropriate TTL (Time-To-Live) values for cache entries to ensure data freshness.
- Use Redis Pub/Sub if you need to broadcast changes to multiple clients (e.g., notifying all users when a new product is added).

#### 5. **Containerization (Docker)**

**Containerization Tasks:**
- Dockerize each component of the application (frontend, backend, database, Redis).
- Write Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend services:
  - **Frontend Dockerfile:** Use a multi-stage build to first build the React app and then serve it using a lightweight server like Nginx.
  - **Backend Dockerfile:** Include steps to install Node.js dependencies, copy the code, and run the application.
  
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage multi-container deployment:
  - Define services for the frontend, backend, Redis, and the database.
  - Use Docker volumes for persistent data storage (e.g., database data).
  - Configure environment variables for different environments (development, production).
  
**Deployment Considerations:**
- For development, use Docker Compose to bring up the entire stack with a single command.
- For production, ensure the use of optimized images (e.g., using Alpine-based images for Node.js).
- Implement health checks and restart policies in your Docker Compose configuration to ensure the services are resilient.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Functionality:** Ensure all features (product management, order management, supplier integration) are implemented and work correctly.
- **Performance:** The system should handle multiple users without significant slowdowns, especially in retrieving product lists and handling large orders.
- **Scalability:** The use of Docker should make it easy to scale the application horizontally.
- **Usability:** The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and provide a smooth user experience.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the system is robust with proper error handling, especially in critical operations like order processing.

### Conclusion

This project will challenge you to integrate various technologies into a cohesive and functional system. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in full-stack development, API design, caching strategies, database management, and containerization. The end result will be a practical application that can be easily deployed and scaled, with real-world utility for businesses needing effective inventory management.
